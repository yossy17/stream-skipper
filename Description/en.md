This script provides functionality to automatically skip intros and endings for the following services:

- [Prime Video](https://amazon.co.jp/gp/video/storefront)
- [Netflix](https://netflix.com)

## Usage

You can change settings with shortcut keys.  
The last two individual settings can only be changed when the overall skip function is turned `ON`.

- `alt + z`: Toggle the overall skip function `ON`/`OFF`.
- `alt + x`: Toggle intro skipping `ON`/`OFF`.
- `alt + c`: Toggle ending skipping `ON`/`OFF`.

The script status can be checked on the HUD displayed at the top-left corner of the screen.  
The HUD displays the current status of intro and ending skipping.
